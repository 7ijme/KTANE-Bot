# Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes BOT

Using C# default speech recognition engine and C# speech synthesis, I made a bot that emulates the manual of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes video game.
All modules can be solved using the bot, using the right key-words.

### Before you give it a go, make sure that...

+ **You are using your default microphone.** The program automatically sets the input to your default audio input device.
+ **You have installed voices for English.** Microsoft David and Microsoft Zira should appear by default. If they don't, then you might not have installed voice for English.
+ **You are using headphones.** You can use speakers too, but you might want to lower the volume, as it might interfere with the audio inputs (the bot can hear itself).
+ **You try different english accents.** This is not my fault. I rarely struggle with my Greek accent, but I haven't tried other accents.
